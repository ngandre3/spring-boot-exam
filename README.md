# spring-boot-exam
This was a exam project for Sheridan College. Spring Boot was used to create a full stack game web app.

The "Guess that Movie" game is where players can guess letters of a Disney movie, similar to Hangman. Players can log in to an account to track their scores. Scoreboard and movie records are managed with admin accounts.

Dependencies used:

- Java
- Spring Web
- Thymeleaf
- Lombok
- Spring Security
- H2 database / SQL

You can read the final PDF report (ngyi_final_exam.pdf) for more information about the design and implementation.
